- Assign courses and track grades
- View detailed student profiles
- Console-based UI with clean structure

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Java (JDK 17+)
- OOP principles (Encapsulation, Inheritance, etc.)
- File I/O for data persistence (optionally extend to JDBC)
- Optional: Swing (for GUI version) or JSON for storage

## 🚀 Getting Started
